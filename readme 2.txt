== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want multiple characters under the same email address, each with a Wordpress login but Wordpress won't allow it =

I recommend the 'Allow Multiple Accounts' plugin by Scott Reilly to work around this issue.

= How do I stop Storytellers/Narrators/Games Masters having full admin access to the Wordpress site? =

Create a role for them called 'storyteller' with the 'manage_options' capability

= Can I have the same Wordpress account for multiple characters? =

No.  The plugin works under the premise that each Wordpress login links to only 1 character.

= How do I get a Google API Key for the map functions? =

You can get a Standard (and free) Google Maps Javascript API key from this google site: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

= Are there any other plugins you recommend for running a game of vampire on Wordpress? =

These are the plugins I have used for the LARP(s) I have been involved in running.

* Members, by Justin Tadlock - useful for adding additional roles for Clans, Storytellers, etc
* User Access Manager, by Alexander Schneider - useful for controlling page access for groups of users based on Roles.
* Download Monitor, by Barry Kooij & Mike Jolley - useful for tracking and formatting download links for house rules, etc.
* Events Made Easy, by Franky Van Liedekerke - organising recurring events and deadlines

= Can I try the plugin out? =

You can try out character generation on the plugin website.

= I get a 404 page when I try to read a character mail =

Try refreshing the Permalinks.  If that doesn't fix the problem then please contact me.

= The format of the page is all messed up when I try to read a character mail =

The page format for viewing character mails comes from the default template in the plugin.  This template might not work with the theme you are using.  In that case, you can create a new template called 'vtmpm.php' in your theme directory.  Enter the below PHP to insert the message content:

    vtm_pm_render_pmmsg();

You can find the default template under vampire-character/templates/vtmpm.php to use as an example.

= Nothing happens when I try to spend experience! =

When there are alot of things to buy with experience then the plugin reaches the limit of the max_input_vars=1000 default PHP setting.

This setting needs to be increased in your site php.ini or .htaccess file.  This will need to be done by your website administrator or by the webhost.

Later versions of the plugin will not have this issue.

= I have an idea for a great new feature! =

Please email me at storyteller@plugin.gvlarp.com with your suggestion

= I found a problem with the plugin =

Please email me at storyteller@plugin.gvlarp.com with information on the problem. Include
exactly what you were doing when you saw the problem and a screen shot to demonstrate
the issue.  Also include any error messages.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= Upgrading to 2.6 / 2.7 =

You will need to review the new Primary Path settings for each of your character generation templates. Save each template once you have updated the settings.

Then go through each character and manually select their primary path in the Disciplines section and add that path to their character (if it doesn't already exist).

Also, consider what to do with the path 'Thaumaturgical Countermagic'.  To conform with the V20 rules, I recommend removing it as a path and adding it to the disciplines data table.  The rules do not mention if this 'discipline' is Clan or Non-Clan for Tremere but it would be my ruling that it was Non-Clan.
